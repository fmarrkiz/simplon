# HTML and CSS

HTML = HyperText Markup Language

CSS = Cascading Style Sheets

React - library<br>
Angular and Vue are frameworks

URL = Uniform Resource Locator

Client / Server Model based on HTTP :

- browser = client
- computer = server

**HTTP** = Hypertext Transfer Protocol
**HTTPS** --> + encryption

    client to server = HTTP request
    server to client = HTTP response

With 
```html 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
</html>
```

the client/browser creates a DOM (= Document Object Model)


### Inspecting HTTP requests and responses

Developper Tools on Firefox <br>
`option + cmd + I`

reload a page : `cmd + R`

then you can check the requests and responses

you can filter them by type (Ex`cause:documents`) or other


## Crete your first HTML document

##### Convention de nommage
HTML n'est pas sensible Ã  la casse mais on tape tout en minuscule sauf `DOCTYPE`
